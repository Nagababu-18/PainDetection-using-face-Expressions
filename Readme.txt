Here’s a complete **README.md** for your **Pain Level Detection Web App** project – structured and clear from setup to usage:

---

# 🧠 Pain Level Detection Web App

This web application allows users to upload or capture a live image using their webcam and predicts the pain level by analyzing facial expressions using a trained deep learning model.

---

## 🔍 Features

✅ Detects **emotion** and maps it to a **pain level**
✅ Supports **camera capture** and **image upload**
✅ Provides **personalized suggestions** based on pain
✅ Includes **motivational quotes**
✅ Supports **voice output** of the prediction
✅ Clean, modern UI with clear **camera control** and **result display**

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pain-level-app.git
cd pain-level-app
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Add the Trained Model

Place your trained model file (`emotion_model.pth`) in the root folder.

> ✅ The model should be a fine-tuned `resnet18` with 7 emotion classes:
> `['happy', 'neutral', 'surprise', 'sad', 'angry', 'fear', 'disgust']`

---

## 🚀 Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Access the app at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## 🧠 Emotion to Pain Mapping

| Emotion  | Pain Level    | Suggestion                             |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Happy    | No Pain       | You're doing great. Keep it up!        |
| Neutral  | No/Mild Pain  | Monitor if changes occur.              |
| Surprise | Mild Pain     | Take a rest. Observe the symptoms.     |
| Sad      | Moderate Pain | Try relaxation, hydration, or support. |
| Angry    | Moderate/High | Could indicate discomfort—stay calm.   |
| Fear     | High Pain     | Breathe deeply, reduce stimuli.        |
| Disgust  | Severe Pain   | Immediate attention may be needed.     |

## 🖥 Usage

1. **Start Camera** – Use webcam for live capture.
2. **Capture Image** – Take a snapshot from the video.
3. **Upload Image** – Or upload a file from your system.
4. **Predict Pain Level** – Model predicts pain and shows suggestion.
5. **Speak Result** – Button reads the result using voice.
6. **Clear** – Resets preview and results.

---

## 📦 Requirements

Sample `requirements.txt`:

```txt
Flask==2.3.3
torch==2.1.0
torchvision==0.16.0
Pillow==10.0.0
```

You can regenerate this file using:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
